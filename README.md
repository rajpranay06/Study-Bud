# Study-Bud
Study Bud - A Discord-style application built with Django for seamless study group collaboration, messaging, and resource sharing.

## Environment Setup

This application uses environment variables for configuration. To set up:

1. Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project
2. Add the following environment variables to the file:

```
GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key_here
```

3. Replace `your_groq_api_key_here` with your actual Groq API key

Note: The `.env` file is excluded from version control via `.gitignore` for security reasons.
